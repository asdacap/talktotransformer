    Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author
    J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry
    Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are
    students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc
    concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends
    to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the
    Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical
    people). This is the dialog between Harry and Ron after the event.
